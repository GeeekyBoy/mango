## Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report for Mango. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

### Before Submitting A Bug Report

- **Make sure you're using the latest version of Mango**. The latest version of Mango might have the bug you're experiencing fixed already.
- **Check the [documentation](https://mangojs.geeekyboy.com/docs)**. You might be able to find the cause of the problem and fix things yourself.
- **Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/GeeekyBoy/mango/issues?q=is%3Aissue)**. Someone might have already reported the same problem. If it's already reported **and the issue is still open**, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- **Perform a cursory search on the internet**. This is a good way to see if the problem is a known issue with a known solution.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

To make sure your bug report gets the attention it deserves, please follow these guidelines:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the problem.
- **Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem** in as many details as possible.
- **Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps**. Include links to files or GitHub projects, or copy/pasteable snippets, which you use in those examples. If you're providing snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/#multiple-lines).
- **Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps** and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
- **Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.**

## Feature Requests

This section guides you through submitting a feature request for Mango. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your suggestion and why it would be useful.

### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

- **Make sure you're using the latest version of Mango**. The latest version of Mango might have the feature you're requesting already.
- **Have a look at the [proposed features](https://github.com/GeeekyBoy/mango/discussions/categories/ideas)**. Someone might have already suggested the same thing.

### How Do I Submit A (Good) Feature Request?

To make sure your feature request gets the attention it deserves, please follow these guidelines:

- **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the dicussion to identify the suggestion.
- **Explain why this feature would be useful** to most Mango users.
- **Describe the solution you'd like**. Be specific and include details of your proposed implementation.
- **List some other projects where this feature exists**. This is a good way to get a feel for how it might work. This is not required, but it can help to get a better picture of what you're suggesting.
- **Describe alternatives you've considered**. This is important so that others can understand the trade-offs you might have thought of.
- **Include UML diagrams** if you think they would help to understand your suggestion.

## Code Contribution Guidelines

### Development Setup

Before you start working on Mango, you'll need to setup your development environment. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Fork the Mango repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-fork-url>
    cd mango
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    npm run bootstrap
    ```
4. Run Mango website locally to test your changes:
    ```bash
    cd website
    npm run start
    ```
  
No need to work on a separate branch. Once you're done, create a pull request to the `main` branch. It's advisable to pull the latest changes from the `main` branch periodically to avoid merge conflicts.

### Codebase

The codebase is organized as a monorepo using [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/). All packages are located in the `packages` directory. Below is a list of all the packages in the repository:

| Package | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| `@mango-js/runtime` | Basic functions required for running Mango applications. |
| `@mango-js/scripts` | Scripts required for building and testing Mango applications. |

### Commit Message Style

Mango commit message guidelines are derived from the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification. Before proceeding, make sure you understand the specification. We add a few extra rules on top of the specification:

#### Format

The commit message must be in the following format. Please note that each line cannot be longer than 72 characters.

```
<type>[(optional scope)]: <subject> <emoji>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

#### Type & Emoji

| Type | Description | Emoji |
| ---- | ----------- | ----- |
| `build` | Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm). This includes changes to the build scripts and package.json files. | üë∑ |
| `ci` | Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: CircleCi, SauceLabs) | üë∑ |
| `docs` | Documentation only changes. This includes changes to the documentation, website, README, etc. | üìù |
| `feat` | A new feature or enhancement that is not a bug fix. | ‚ú® |
| `fix` | A bug fix. | üêõ |
| `perf` | A code change that improves performance | ‚ö°Ô∏è |
| `refactor` | A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature | ‚ôªÔ∏è |
| `test` | Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests | üß™ |
| `revert` | Reverting a previous commit. | ‚è™ |
| `chore` | Changes that don't fit any of the above categories | [choose](https://gitmoji.dev/) |

#### Scope

Scope is optional. It can be anything specifying the place of the commit change. A common use case is when commiting a change in the README file where the commit message would be `docs(readme): <subject> üìù`.

#### Subject

- **Use the imperative, present tense**: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
- **Capitalize the first letter**.
- **Don't end the subject with a period or any other punctuation**.
- **Initials must be uppercased**: `IE rejects CSS classes starting with _` not `ie rejects css classes starting with _`.

#### Body

- **Use the imperative, present tense**: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
- **Capitalize the first letter of each sentence**.

### Pull Requests Rules

Here's some rules to follow when submitting a pull request. These rules are strictly enforced to ensure a high quality of the codebase.

- **One pull request per feature**. If you want to add multiple features, create multiple pull requests.
- **One pull request per bug fix**. If you want to fix multiple bugs, create multiple pull requests.
- **Don't commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix**. For example, if you are working on a feature that only affects the `@mango-js/runtime` package, don't fix typos in the documentation. This will make it easier for the reviewer to focus on the changes that matter.
- **Don't bump the version number**. The version number will be bumped by the maintainer when a new version is published to NPM.
- **Don't manipulate the changelog**. The changelog will be updated by the maintainer when a new version is published to NPM.
- **Don't create a new package**. If you want to create a new package, please create a new discussion first to discuss the idea.
