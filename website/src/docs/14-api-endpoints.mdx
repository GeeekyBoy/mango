# API Endpoints

## Overview

Creation of API endpoints in Mango is as simple as creating a new JSX file. All endpoints are defined through the file structure of the `routes` directory as discussed in the previous chapter. In this chapter, we are focusing on how to write the code for the endpoints themselves.

## Writing an Endpoint

Endpoints are written in the same way as `.ssr.js` files which are discussed in the [Dynamic Content](/docs/dynamic-content) chapter. There only 3 differences between the two:

- Unlike `.ssr.js` files whose data object is a group of keyed results, the data object for an endpoint is a single serializable result. This is because the data object is the response body of the endpoint.
- In `.ssr.js` files, for every key in the data object there is a corresponding exported variable. In endpoints, it doesn't make sense to do this.
- The object passed to the exported function of the endpoint contains an additional `body` property which contains the request body of the endpoint. You may not use it for GET and DELETE requests.

```javascript
// routes/api/[animal]/+get.js

import { nanoid } from "nanoid";

export default async ({ route }) => {
  return {
    data: {
      serveTime: new Date().toISOString(),
      uid: nanoid(),
      message: `I love ${route.params.animal}!`,
    },
  };
};
```
