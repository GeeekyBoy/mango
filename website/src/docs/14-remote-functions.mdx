# Remote Functions

## Overview

Remote functions are JavaScript functions that are executed on the server-side under the hood without the need to care about the api endpoint used to do the job. It's a revolutionary feature that makes it easier to debug and maintain the interaction between the client and the server.

## Usage

As a remote function is meant to appear as an ordinary client-side JavaScript function, it's exported as any other function from a NodeJS module whose filename is suffixed with `.remote.js`.

```javascript
// timezone.remote.js

export const getTimezone = async (lat=31.20, long=29.92) => {
  const response = await fetch(`https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=${lat}&longitude=${long}&timezone=auto`);
  const data = await response.json();
  return {
    name: data["timezone"],
    abbr: data["timezone_abbreviation"],
    offset: data["utc_offset_seconds"],
  };
};
```

```jsx
// App.jsx

import { getTimezone } from "./timezone.remote.js";

export default function App() {
  let $name = null;
  let $abbr = null;
  let $offset = null;
  getTimezone().then(({ name, abbr, offset }) => {
    $name = name;
    $abbr = abbr;
    $offset = offset;
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Timezone Information</h1>
      <p>City: Alexandria, Egypt</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Name: {$name}</li>
        <li>Abbreviation: {$abbr}</li>
        <li>Offset: {$offset}</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Limitations

As an implication of executing the function on the server-side, the following limitations apply:

- Function has to be asynchronous and return a promise.
- Disability to access anything on the client-side other than the arguments passed.
- Arguments passed to the function are serialized and deserialized using JSON.
- Values returned from the function are serialized and deserialized using JSON.

## Browser Support

Remote functions rely on the [Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) API which is supported by all modern browsers, but not by old browsers like Internet Explorer.
